It might make sense if you're writing something like a proxy service in Python, and you just want something at the lowest possible level, but more typically you'll want to use a higher level client library, such as httpx . The motivation for httpcore is: To provide a reusable low-level client library, that other packages can then build on top of. To provide a really clear interface split between the networking code and client logic, so that each is easier to understand and reason about in isolation.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#http-core","text":"Do one thing, and do it well.
